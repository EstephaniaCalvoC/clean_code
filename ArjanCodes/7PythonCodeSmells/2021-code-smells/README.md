# 7 Python code smells

This repository contains the code for the Python code smells video on the ArjanCodes channel (watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/LrtnLEkOwFE)).

The example is about employees at a company. In `before.py`, you find the original code (containing 7 code smells + a bonus smell). The `after.py` file contains the same code, but a lot less smelly.
